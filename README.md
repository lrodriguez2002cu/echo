# echo - A sample project for echoing some of the request properties.

This repository was created in order to debug the behavior of the NGINX custom external authentication contract [](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/examples/customization/external-auth-headers/).

But is a general, small project for echoing the headers, body and other request data sent to the endpoint.
